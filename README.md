## Corsair K65 Keyboard (ISO UK)

Name: Vengeance K65 Compact Mechanical Gaming Keyboard â€“ (UK English)
Part Number: CH-9000040-UK

The script here makes it possible to use the K65 with UK layout under macOS Catalina. It may work with earlier releases, but I have only tested it on macOS Catalina. It definitely requires at least macOS Sierra (10.12) for the hidutil program.

Using a combination of macOS settings and the script, it's possible to use all the ISO UK keys and still benefit from special macOS key combinations like `Option + e e` to get an e-acute.

### Requirements

- Swap Option and Command, so that the Windows key maps to Option, and Alt maps to Command. To do that, open the "System Preferences" app, then open "Keyboard", then open `Modifier Keys...`, select the keyboard in the drop-down box, then swap the keys in the other drop-down boxes.

- Add "British - PC" to the list of input sources. To do that, open the "System Preferences" app, then open "Keyboard", then "Input Sources". Click on the plus to add `British - PC`, and then move it to the top to activate it. You should also enable the Input Sources icon in the menu bar, to make it easier to switch to/from different layouts later.

### Usage

```
./Corsair-K65-ISO-UK.sh
```

### Notes

- Switch input source using `Ctrl + Space` (brings up menu) or `Ctrl + Option (Windows) + Space` to cycle through them.

- The right Application key (context menu key) is mapped to the Windows key, which means it's effectively the Option key.

- Media keys `Fn + F10-F12` work out of the box on macOS Catalina (previous, play/pause, next).

- Special volume media keys at top (mute, volume up/down) work out of the box on macOS Catalina.

### Known Problems

- The `Command + \` shortcut for 1Password doesn't work. It seems like that's mapped at a lower level than the mappings set up by the script. Instead, use `Command + #` on the keyboard. (Note `Command` = `Alt` on the actual keys.)

- F-keys don't work because there are some pre-existing shortcuts by macOS set up that bypass the F-keys. It's possible to disable this behaviour, by disabling the shortcuts.

- `Home/End/etc.` keys don't work.

- How to have this applied during Mac startup? (Currently it's lost across restarts. And sometimes on long sleeps -- or perhaps when you unplug the keyboard? Yes, when you unplug the keyboard.)

- `Fn + F9` doesn't work right now (stop media key) -- why is that?

- Windows lock button doesn't seem to do anything on macOS Catalina.
